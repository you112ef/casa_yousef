SOLUTION: CANNOT ADD MORE THAN 10 CASES ISSUE
==========================================

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
-----------------
The user reports that they cannot add more than 10 cases to the Sky CASA application.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
----------------------
After thorough investigation of the application code and database structure, no explicit limit of 10 cases was found in:

1. Database constraints - No triggers or constraints limiting record count
2. Application code - No business logic limiting case creation
3. UI code - No display limits preventing more than 10 cases from being shown
4. Configuration files - No settings limiting the number of cases

The only references to "10" found in the codebase are:
- In GetSampleData methods (DataAccessLayer.cs/vb) which have a default limit of 10 for retrieving sample data
- These are for display purposes only and do not affect actual data storage

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
------------------
The application database contains the following tables:
- sem, ret, stool, urine, cbc, vis, dr, path, log
- No table named "patients" or "cases" was found
- The "cbc" table is designed to store Complete Blood Count test results

VERIFICATION STEPS:
------------------
1. Run the database examination tool to check current record counts:
   - The database currently contains records in various tables
   - No table has an explicit limit of 10 records

2. Test case addition:
   - The application should allow adding more than 10 cases
   - If there's an issue, it's likely in the UI display rather than data storage

SOLUTION:
--------
1. Verify actual database capacity:
   - The SQLite database can store thousands of records
   - There is no technical limit preventing more than 10 cases

2. Check UI display:
   - The UI might be using GetSampleData methods which have a default limit of 10
   - Modify UI code to display all records instead of just samples

3. Implementation recommendations:
   - Replace calls to GetSampleData() with queries that retrieve all data
   - Add pagination controls for better user experience with large datasets
   - Implement proper data binding to display all records

CODE MODIFICATION EXAMPLE:
-------------------------
Instead of:
DataTable sampleData = dal.GetSampleData("cbc", 10); // Only gets 10 records

Use:
DataTable allData = dal.ExecuteQuery("SELECT * FROM cbc"); // Gets all records

Or with a larger limit:
DataTable moreData = dal.GetSampleData("cbc", 100); // Gets up to 100 records

CONCLUSION:
----------
The "cannot add more than 10 cases" issue is likely a display limitation rather than a storage limitation. The application can store more than 10 cases, but the UI might only be showing a sample of 10 records. To fix this:

1. Modify the UI code to display all records
2. Implement proper pagination for better performance with large datasets
3. Ensure data binding is correctly configured to show all records

No changes to the database or core business logic are required as there are no actual limits preventing more than 10 cases from being stored.
