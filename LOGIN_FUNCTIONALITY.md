# Sky CASA Application Login Functionality

## Overview
This document describes the login functionality that has been added to the Sky CASA medical laboratory analysis system. The application now requires users to authenticate before accessing the main application interface.

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Method
The application authenticates users against the `admin` table in the SQLite database (`database.db`). The login form verifies the username and password provided by the user against the records stored in the database.

### Default Credentials
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123

These credentials are set up during the initial database setup and can be verified using the `SetupAdminUser.ps1` script.

### Files Created
1. `LoginForm.cs` - The login form implementation
2. `LoginVerifier.cs` - Authentication logic
3. `create_login_app.bat` - Script to compile the login-enabled version
4. `Run_Sky_CASA_With_Login.bat` - Script to run the application with login verification
5. `Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe` - The new executable with login functionality
6. `add_login_functionality.ps1` - PowerShell script that sets up the login functionality

### How It Works
1. When the user runs `Run_Sky_CASA_With_Login.bat`, it launches `Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe`
2. The login form is displayed, prompting the user for credentials
3. The entered credentials are verified against the `admin` table in the database
4. If authentication is successful, the main Sky CASA application is launched
5. If authentication fails or is cancelled, the application exits

## Database Integration
The login functionality is fully integrated with the existing database structure:
- Uses the same `database.db` file as the main application
- Authenticates against the `admin` table
- Maintains consistency with existing user management

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are stored in plain text in the database (as per the existing implementation)
- For production use, it is recommended to implement password hashing
- The login form uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks

## Usage Instructions
1. Run `Run_Sky_CASA_With_Login.bat` to start the application with login verification
2. Enter the username and password when prompted
3. If authentication is successful, the main application will launch
4. Use the default credentials (admin/admin123) or any other credentials stored in the admin table

## Verification
To verify that the login functionality is working correctly:
1. Run `TestDBConnection.ps1` to confirm database connectivity
2. Run `SetupAdminUser.ps1` to verify or reset the admin credentials
3. Run `Run_Sky_CASA_With_Login.bat` to test the login process

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the login functionality:
1. Verify that `database.db` exists and is accessible
2. Check that the `admin` table contains the expected user records
3. Ensure all required DLLs are present in the application directory
4. Run `TestDBConnection.ps1` to diagnose database connectivity issues
5. If the login window doesn't appear, run `create_login_app.bat` to recreate the login-enabled application

## Recent Fix
**Issue**: Login-enabled application was not working due to missing `LoginVerifier.cs` file causing "Failed to load file or assembly" error
**Solution**: Recreated the `LoginVerifier.cs` file and recompiled the application using `create_login_app.bat`
**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Login functionality is now working correctly

The assembly loading issue has been resolved by:
1. Recreating the missing `LoginVerifier.cs` file
2. Successfully recompiling the login-enabled application
3. Verifying that `Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe` runs correctly

## Future Improvements
1. Implement password hashing for improved security
2. Add support for multiple user roles
3. Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
4. Add password complexity requirements
5. Implement "Remember Me" functionality
