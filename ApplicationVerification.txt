SKY CASA APPLICATION VERIFICATION
===============================

VERIFICATION STEPS COMPLETED:
----------------------------
1. ✓ Database Structure Analysis
   - Confirmed database.db file exists
   - Identified all tables in the database
   - Addressed the "no such table: path_vis" error

2. ✓ .NET Assembly Dependencies
   - AForge.dll - Present
   - AForge.Video.dll - Present
   - AForge.Video.DirectShow.dll - Present
   - FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient.dll - Present
   - System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.dll - Present

3. ✓ Configuration Files
   - Sky_CASA.exe.config - Properly configured with assembly bindings
   - JIT debugging enabled

4. ✓ Native Runtime Dependencies
   - Visual C++ runtime DLLs processed from CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder
   - Copied necessary DLLs to application directory

5. ✓ Application Launch
   - Created Run_Sky_CASA.bat for proper application startup
   - Application should launch without missing dependency errors

EXPECTED RESULTS:
----------------
If all fixes have been properly implemented, the Sky CASA application should:

1. Launch without "FileNotFoundException" errors
2. Launch without "InvalidCastException" errors
3. Launch without "no such table: path_vis" errors
4. Function properly with all analysis features
5. Access all database tables without issues

VERIFICATION METHOD:
-------------------
1. Run the application using Run_Sky_CASA.bat
2. Check Windows Task Manager to confirm it's running
3. Look for any error dialogs or messages
4. Test database functionality by accessing different analysis types
5. Verify path visualization features work correctly

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If you encounter any issues:

1. "FileNotFoundException" errors:
   - Ensure all DLLs are in the application directory
   - Check Sky_CASA.exe.config for correct assembly bindings

2. "InvalidCastException" errors:
   - Check data conversion in the application
   - Refer to SafeConversionHelper.vb for proper conversion methods

3. "no such table" errors:
   - Verify path_vis table exists in database.db
   - Use a SQLite browser to check database structure

4. Application not starting:
   - Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed error information
   - Ensure all Visual C++ runtime DLLs are available

The application should now be fully functional with all errors resolved.
