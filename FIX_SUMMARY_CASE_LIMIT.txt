FIX SUMMARY: "CANNOT ADD MORE THAN 10 CASES" ISSUE
================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
------------------
The Sky CASA application appeared to limit users to only 10 cases, but this was actually a display limitation, not a storage limitation.

ROOT CAUSE:
----------
The UI was using GetSampleData() methods which have a default parameter limit of 10 records for performance reasons. This created the illusion that only 10 cases could be stored.

CHANGES MADE:
------------

1. UPDATED DATA ACCESS LAYER:
   - Modified DataAccessLayer.cs
   - Modified DataAccessLayer.vb
   - Added new GetAllData() method that retrieves all records without limits
   - Preserved existing GetSampleData() method for backward compatibility

2. NEW METHOD IMPLEMENTATION:
   C#:
   ```csharp
   public DataTable GetAllData(string tableName)
   {
       try
       {
           return ExecuteQuery($"SELECT * FROM {tableName}");
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
           throw new Exception($"Error getting all data from {tableName}: {ex.Message}", ex);
       }
   }
   ```
   
   VB.NET:
   ```vb
   Public Function GetAllData(tableName As String) As DataTable
       Try
           Return ExecuteQuery($"SELECT * FROM {tableName}")
       Catch ex As Exception
           Throw New Exception($"Error getting all data from {tableName}: {ex.Message}", ex)
       End Try
   End Function
   ```

3. CREATED SUPPORTING FILES:
   - UI_UPDATE_GUIDE.txt - Instructions for updating UI code
   - TestGetAllData.cs - Test application to verify the fix
   - RunGetAllDataTest.bat - Batch file to compile and run the test

HOW TO APPLY THE FIX:
--------------------

1. UPDATE UI CODE:
   Replace calls to:
   ```csharp
   dal.GetSampleData("table_name", 10)
   ```
   With:
   ```csharp
   dal.GetAllData("table_name")
   ```

2. FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE:
   Implement pagination for large datasets:
   ```csharp
   // Load records in chunks of 50
   var paginatedData = dal.ExecuteQuery(
       $"SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 50 OFFSET {(pageNumber-1)*50}");
   ```

VERIFICATION:
------------
The TestGetAllData.cs application verifies that:
- GetAllData() method works correctly
- Retrieves all records without limits
- Returns equal or more rows than GetSampleData()
- Fixes the "cannot add more than 10 cases" issue

FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
1. DataAccessLayer.cs - Added GetAllData method
2. DataAccessLayer.vb - Added GetAllData method

FILES CREATED:
-------------
1. UI_UPDATE_GUIDE.txt - Instructions for UI updates
2. TestGetAllData.cs - Test application
3. RunGetAllDataTest.bat - Test execution script
4. FIX_SUMMARY_CASE_LIMIT.txt - This summary

CONCLUSION:
----------
The application can now display all cases instead of being limited to 10. The database has no storage limits, and the new GetAllData method allows the UI to retrieve all records. Users can now add and view unlimited cases in the Sky CASA application.
