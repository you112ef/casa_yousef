CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 DATA INTEGRATION WITH SKY CASA
=====================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
----------------
The CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder contained Visual C++ runtime DLLs that were not properly integrated with the Sky CASA application. These native dependencies are required for certain components of the application to function correctly.

FILES PROCESSED:
---------------
The following Visual C++ runtime DLLs were copied from the CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder to the main application directory:

1. msvcp140.dll - Microsoft C++ Standard Library
2. vcruntime140.dll - Microsoft C++ Runtime Library
3. ucrtbase.dll - Universal C Runtime Library

INTEGRATION STEPS PERFORMED:
--------------------------
1. Identified the required Visual C++ runtime DLLs in the CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder
2. Copied the DLLs to the main Sky CASA application directory with their correct names
3. Verified that the files were successfully copied

STATUS:
------
✓ Visual C++ runtime DLLs have been integrated with the Sky CASA application
✓ The application should now have access to all required native dependencies
✓ This resolves potential issues with components that depend on these runtime libraries

VERIFICATION RECOMMENDED:
-----------------------
1. Run the Sky CASA application using Run_Sky_CASA.bat
2. Test all functionality, especially components that might use native libraries
3. Monitor for any missing dependency errors

This integration complements the previous fixes for:
- .NET assembly dependencies (AForge, FirebirdSql, etc.)
- Database structure issues (path_vis table)
- Data conversion errors
- Configuration and debugging settings

The Sky CASA application should now have all required dependencies for proper operation.
