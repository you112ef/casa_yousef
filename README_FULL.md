# Sky CASA - Medical Laboratory Analysis System

## Overview
Sky CASA is a comprehensive medical laboratory analysis application designed for processing and analyzing various types of medical tests including CBC (Complete Blood Count), urinalysis, stool analysis, and more. The system provides healthcare professionals with tools to manage patient data, perform analysis, and generate reports.

## Features
- Complete Blood Count (CBC) analysis
- Patient data management
- Test result recording and analysis
- Data visualization capabilities
- Quality control and validation
- Multi-user support with role-based access
- Report generation and printing

## Recent Fix: Case Limit Issue
This version includes a fix for the "cannot add more than 10 cases" issue:

### Problem
Users reported that they could not add or view more than 10 cases in the application, even though the database was capable of storing more records.

### Root Cause
The issue was identified as a UI display limitation, not a storage limitation:
- The database (SQLite) can store unlimited records
- The application business logic does not limit case creation
- The UI was using `GetSampleData()` methods with a default limit of 10 records
- This created the illusion of a 10-case limit

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the DataAccessLayer with a new method that retrieves all records without limits:

1. Added `GetAllData()` method to both C# and VB versions of DataAccessLayer
2. Created UI update guide and automation tools
3. Provided comprehensive verification tools

### Files Modified
- `DataAccessLayer.cs` - Added GetAllData method
- `DataAccessLayer.vb` - Added GetAllData method

### Files Created
- `UI_UPDATE_GUIDE.txt` - Instructions for updating UI code
- `UpdateUIDataAccess.ps1` - PowerShell script to automate UI updates
- `RunUIUpdate.bat` - Batch file to run the PowerShell script
- `VerifyCaseLimitFix.cs` - Comprehensive verification tool
- `RunVerification.bat` - Batch file to compile and run verification
- `COMPLETE_CASE_LIMIT_FIX_GUIDE.txt` - Complete guide explaining the fix

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Run `RunUIUpdate.bat` to automatically update UI code to use `GetAllData()` instead of `GetSampleData()`
2. Or manually update UI forms by replacing calls to `GetSampleData("table_name", 10)` with `GetAllData("table_name")`
3. For large datasets, consider implementing pagination for better performance

## Database
The application uses SQLite for local data storage with the following tables:
- sem, ret, stool, urine, cbc, vis, dr, path, log, admin
- Patients - Patient information
- Technicians - Lab technician information
- AnalysisTypes - Types of analysis available
- CBCTestResults - CBC test results
- CBC_NormalRanges - Normal ranges for CBC parameters

## Dependencies
- AForge.NET libraries for image processing
- Firebird SQL Client for database operations
- System.Data.SQLite for SQLite database access
- System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions for async operations
