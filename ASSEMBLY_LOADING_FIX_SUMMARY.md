# Assembly Loading Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The login-enabled version of the Sky CASA application was failing with a "Failed to load file or assembly" error. This occurred because the `LoginVerifier.cs` file was missing, which is required to compile the login verification component.

## Root Cause
The `create_login_app.bat` batch file was designed to:
1. Compile `LoginVerifier.cs` into `LoginVerifier.dll`
2. Create a wrapper executable (`Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe`)
3. Clean up temporary files including `LoginVerifier.cs`, `SkyCASALauncher.cs`, and `LoginVerifier.dll`

However, the `LoginVerifier.cs` file had been deleted and was not in the repository, causing the compilation to fail.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Recreated the missing file**: Created a new `LoginVerifier.cs` file with the required functionality:
   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Data.SQLite;
   using System.Windows.Forms;

   public class LoginVerifier
   {
       public static bool VerifyLogin(string databasePath)
       {
           LoginForm loginForm = new LoginForm(databasePath);
           DialogResult result = loginForm.ShowDialog();
           return result == DialogResult.OK;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Successfully recompiled**: Ran `create_login_app.bat` which successfully compiled the login verifier and created `Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe`

3. **Updated documentation**: Modified `LOGIN_FUNCTIONALITY.md` to document the fix

4. **Updated changelog**: Added the fix to `CHANGELOG.md`

5. **Modified batch file**: Updated `create_login_app.bat` to keep `LoginVerifier.cs` for Git management

6. **Committed and pushed changes**: All changes were committed to Git and pushed to GitHub

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
1. Successfully running `create_login_app.bat` without errors
2. Confirming that `Sky_CASA_With_Login.exe` is created (4.5KB)
3. Testing that the login functionality works correctly

## Files Modified/Added
- `LoginVerifier.cs` (new file)
- `LOGIN_FUNCTIONALITY.md` (updated)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (updated)
- `create_login_app.bat` (updated)

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The assembly loading issue has been resolved and the login-enabled application is now working correctly.
