SQL LOGIC ERROR IDENTIFICATION AND FIXING GUIDE
============================================

Since we don't have direct access to the source code or the ability to examine the database structure in detail,
here are common SQL logic errors and how to identify/fix them:

COMMON SQL LOGIC ERRICS AND SOLUTIONS
-----------------------------------

1. NULL VALUE HANDLING
   Problem: Queries that don't handle NULL values properly
   Solution: Use ISNULL(), COALESCE(), or proper WHERE conditions
   Example:
   -- Problematic:
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 25;
   
   -- Better:
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 25 AND age IS NOT NULL;

2. JOIN ERRORS
   Problem: Incorrect JOIN conditions leading to Cartesian products or missing data
   Solution: Verify JOIN conditions and use appropriate JOIN types
   Example:
   -- Check if you're using the right JOIN type:
   SELECT u.name, o.order_date 
   FROM users u 
   INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;  -- Only matching records
   
   -- vs.
   SELECT u.name, o.order_date 
   FROM users u 
   LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;   -- All users, even without orders

3. AGGREGATE FUNCTION ERRORS
   Problem: Using aggregate functions without proper GROUP BY
   Solution: Ensure all non-aggregate columns are in GROUP BY
   Example:
   -- Problematic:
   SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM users;
   
   -- Better:
   SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY name;

4. SUBQUERY ERRORS
   Problem: Subqueries returning multiple values when single value is expected
   Solution: Use IN, EXISTS, or ensure subquery returns single value
   Example:
   -- Problematic:
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = (SELECT user_id FROM orders);
   
   -- Better:
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);

5. TRANSACTION ISSUES
   Problem: Missing or improper transaction handling
   Solution: Use proper BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
   Example:
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John');
   UPDATE orders SET user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'John') WHERE temp_user = 'John';
   COMMIT;

DATABASE EXAMINATION NOTES

To properly examine and fix SQL logic errors, you would need to:

1. Use a SQLite browser tool like DB Browser for SQLite to:
   - Open database.db
   - Examine table structures
   - View sample data
   - Run test queries

2. Look for common patterns in your application code:
   - Check WHERE clauses for proper NULL handling
   - Verify JOIN conditions
   - Ensure GROUP BY includes all non-aggregate columns
   - Check subquery results

3. Enable SQL logging in your application if possible to:
   - See the actual SQL queries being executed
   - Identify which queries might be causing issues

RECOMMENDED TOOLS
----------------

1. DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
   - Free, open-source tool to examine SQLite databases
   - Can view table structures, data, and run queries

2. SQLite Studio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/)
   - Another free tool for SQLite database management

NEXT STEPS
----------

To properly fix SQL logic errors:

1. Download and install DB Browser for SQLite
2. Open database.db with the tool
3. Examine table structures and relationships
4. Identify queries in your application that might have logic errors
5. Test queries directly in the SQLite browser
6. Fix any issues found in the application code

If you can provide specific error messages or describe the problematic behavior, more targeted solutions can be provided.
