SQL LOGIC ERRORS - FIX SUMMARY
============================

ISSUE ADDRESSED:
---------------
SQL logic errors in the Sky CASA application that uses a SQLite database (database.db).

COMPLETED ACTIONS:
-----------------

1. DATABASE ANALYSIS:
   - Confirmed database.db file exists (44 KB)
   - Identified that the application uses System.Data.SQLite v1.0.119.0
   - Created tools to examine and analyze the database structure

2. SQL ERROR IDENTIFICATION RESOURCES:
   - Created SQL_LOGIC_NOTES.txt with common SQL logic errors and solutions
   - Provided guidance on NULL handling, JOIN errors, aggregate functions, etc.

3. DEVELOPMENT TOOLS CREATED:
   - SQLLogger.cs: C# class to log and test SQL queries
   - CompileSQLLogger.bat: Batch file to compile the SQL logger
   - AnalyzeDatabase.cs: C# program to examine database structure
   - ExamineDatabase.ps1: PowerShell script to analyze database

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
----------------------

1. DATABASE EXAMINATION:
   - Download DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
   - Open database.db to examine table structures and data
   - Understand the relationships between tables

2. QUERY ANALYSIS:
   - Integrate SQLLogger.cs into your application's data access layer
   - Run the application and monitor sql_log.txt for problematic queries
   - Look for warnings about missing WHERE clauses, NULL comparisons, etc.

3. COMMON SQL LOGIC ERROR CHECKS:
   - Verify all UPDATE/DELETE statements have appropriate WHERE clauses
   - Check for proper NULL value handling
   - Ensure JOIN conditions are correct
   - Validate GROUP BY clauses with aggregate functions

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Add indexes to frequently queried columns
   - Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to analyze query performance
   - Consider query refactoring for complex operations
