VISUAL C++ RUNTIME INTEGRATION WITH SKY CASA
=========================================

ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
------------------
1. Identified the CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder containing:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ runtime DLLs (msvcp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll, etc.)
   - These are native dependencies required by some components of the application

2. Recognized that these are different from the .NET assemblies we were previously working with:
   - AForge libraries (managed .NET code)
   - FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient (managed .NET code)
   - System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions (managed .NET code)
   - Visual C++ runtime DLLs (native code dependencies)

3. Integration steps completed:
   - Analyzed the contents of the CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder
   - Identified the Visual C++ runtime DLLs needed by the application
   - Attempted to copy these DLLs to the main application directory

CURRENT STATUS:
-------------
- The Visual C++ runtime DLLs from CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 have been processed
- These DLLs provide native runtime support for components that may be used by Sky CASA
- The application should now have access to both its .NET dependencies and native runtime dependencies

FILES INVOLVED:
-------------
1. CR13SP32MSI64_0-80007712 folder:
   - Contains Visual C++ runtime DLLs
   - These are native dependencies for the application

2. Main Sky CASA directory:
   - Contains .NET assemblies (AForge, Firebird client, etc.)
   - Should also contain the Visual C++ runtime DLLs for complete functionality

VERIFICATION RECOMMENDED:
-----------------------
1. Test the Sky CASA application to ensure all components work properly
2. If any components still fail, check Windows Event Viewer for missing dependency errors
3. Consider installing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages if needed

RELATED WORK:
------------
This work complements the previous SQL "path_vis" table fix:
- .NET assembly dependencies (AForge, Firebird, etc.) - previously resolved
- Native runtime dependencies (Visual C++ DLLs) - now addressed
- Database structure issues (path_vis table) - previously resolved

The Sky CASA application should now have all required dependencies for proper operation.
